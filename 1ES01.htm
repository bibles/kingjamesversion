for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is with me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V28">28&nbsp;</a></span>Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V29">29&nbsp;</a></span>But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and the princes came against king Josias. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V30">30&nbsp;</a></span>Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took him away out of the battle. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V31">31&nbsp;</a></span>Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father’s sepulchre. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V32">32&nbsp;</a></span>And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V33">33&nbsp;</a></span>These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V34">34&nbsp;</a></span>And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty and three years old. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V35">35&nbsp;</a></span>And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V36">36&nbsp;</a></span>And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V37">37&nbsp;</a></span>The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V38">38&nbsp;</a></span>And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brother he apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V39">39&nbsp;</a></span>Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V40">40&nbsp;</a></span>Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V41">41&nbsp;</a></span>Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V42">42&nbsp;</a></span>But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleaness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V43">43&nbsp;</a></span>And Joacim his son reigned in his stead: he was made king being eighteen years old; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V44">44&nbsp;</a></span>And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil before the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V45">45&nbsp;</a></span>So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V46">46&nbsp;</a></span>And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V47">47&nbsp;</a></span>And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth of the Lord. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V48">48&nbsp;</a></span>And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V49">49&nbsp;</a></span>The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things against the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V50">50&nbsp;</a></span>Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V51">51&nbsp;</a></span>But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when the Lord spake unto them, they made a sport of his prophets: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V52">52&nbsp;</a></span>So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against them; </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V53">53&nbsp;</a></span>Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compass of their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V54">54&nbsp;</a></span>And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king’s treasures, and carried them away into Babylon. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V55">55&nbsp;</a></span>As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V56">56&nbsp;</a></span>And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had consumed and brought them all to nought: and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V57">57&nbsp;</a></span>Who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy: </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse"> <a name="V58">58&nbsp;</a></span>Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she rest, until the full term of seventy years. </div><hr>
